Exercise: Conditional Statements
In this exercise, you will use conditional statements to categorise people based on their ages.
"""

# 1. Ask the user for their age as input and convert it to an integer.
# Convert the user_age_str to an integer
# 2. Use conditional statements to categorise the user into one of the following categories:
# - If age is less than 18, print "You are a minor."
# - If age is between 18 and 65 (inclusive), print "You are an adult."
# - If age is 66 or higher, print "You are a senior citizen."

Exercise: Loops
In this exercise, you will use a loop to print numbers up to a user-defined limit.
"""

# 1. Ask the user to enter a number as the limit and convert it to an integer.
# Convert the limit_str to an integer
# 2. Use a  for loop to iterate from 1 to the user-defined limit (inclusive) and print each number.
# Use a while loop to iterate from 1 to the user-defined limit (inclusive) and print each number.
# Initialise a variable to start the loop

Exercise: Loop Control Statements
In this exercise, you will use a loop and loop control statements to print odd numbers.
"""

# 1. Ask the user to enter a number as the limit and convert it to an integer.
# Convert the limit_str to an integer
# 2. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to the user-defined limit (inclusive).
# 3. Inside the loop, use a loop control statement to skip even numbers and print odd numbers.

Exercise: Nested Loops
In this exercise, you will use nested loops to generate a multiplication table.
